      "The Asri Dive & Leisure Resort began with a simple dream: to create an intimate seaside sanctuary where world-class diving and warm Filipino hospitality come together in one unforgettable experience. Nestled in Sitio Balagbag, Barangay Bagalangit in Mabini, Batangas, just a few hours from Manila, The Asri was designed for people who want more than a quick escape—they want a place that feels like a second home by the sea.",
      "From the start, the vision was clear: keep it small, keep it personal, and keep the standards high. With only around 14 waterfront rooms, The Asri was intentionally built to stay boutique. This intimacy allows the team to know guests by name, understand their goals—whether it is completing a first PADI course, chasing rare macro critters, or simply unwinding by the infinity pool—and tailor each stay around them.",
      "Earning PADI 5-Star Dive Resort accreditation became a natural extension of that commitment. It formalized what guests were already experiencing: safe, professional, and thoughtfully guided diving in one of the richest marine biodiversity areas in the world. Today, our instructors and dive professionals welcome everyone—from nervous beginners to seasoned photographers—to explore over 30 nearby dive sites with confidence and curiosity.",
      "Wrapped in a Thai-inspired aesthetic, surrounded by Balayan Bay sunsets, and supported by a team that genuinely cares, The Asri continues to grow not by becoming bigger, but by becoming better—one guest, one dive, and one shared story at a time."
